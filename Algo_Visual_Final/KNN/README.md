# Interactive KNN:

This project involves generating a dataset and visualizing it using the k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN) algorithm. The code provided performs the following steps:

- Define the dimensions and options for the display, including width and height.
- Specify the types of data points as 'A' and 'B'.
- Generate random coordinates for an ellipsoid shape.
- Create a dataset with random coordinates for each type of data point.
- Set the value of k (number of nearest neighbors) to 5.
- Visualize the dataset using the k-NN algorithm.

The resulting visualization shows the data points as circles on a black background, with different fill colors representing each type. The k-NN algorithm determines the classification of each data point based on its nearest neighbors.

To run the project, simply execute the index.html file. The visualization will be displayed in the specified dimensions and options.

# Note:

- This project utilizes the d3ml library for visualization purposes.
