      <p>The code uses recursion to generate the <strong>Barnsley fern fractal</strong>. Starting from the initial point (0, 0), the <strong>generatePoint</strong> function is called repeatedly with different transformation rules and generates a single point on the canvas. Each point is colored based on the depth of recursion that produced it. The function <strong>generateFractal</strong> uses a loop to generate the Barnsley fern fractal by repeatedly calling <strong>generatePoint</strong> with different initial points and colors based on recursion depth.</p>
      <p>The code is based on the <strong>Barnsley fern fractal</strong> discovered by mathematician <strong>Michael Barnsley</strong> in 1988. The mathematical basis for the Barnsley fern can be found in his paper "Fractals Everywhere" (1988).</p>
