      In the visualization you can see how the <strong>k-nearest neighbor (KNN)</strong> algorithm
      <strong>classifies</strong> new data points based on their <strong>k</strong> nearest neighbors, where the amount of neighbors k is specified using the slider above. The new point will be assigned the <strong>class</strong> that the majority of its k nearest neighbors hold.
      </p>
      <p>If you check the <strong>"Weighted" checkbox</strong> above, the algorithm is justified, so that the <strong>inverse of the distance</strong> of the k neighbors is taken into account. This is important during "ties", meaning that you chose an even amount of neighbors k and half of them are class red while the other half are blue.</p>
      <p>If you don't use the weighted version of KNN in this case, the neighbor with the closest distance will <strong>ALWAYS</strong> win.</p>
