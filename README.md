# Course: Algorithm and Visualisation

- Professor: Will Rosenbaum

# In this course
 - explore how algorithmic and aesthetic principles can be employed in concert to create interactive graphical content on the web.
 - Topics include design layout and combinatorial optimization, the geometry of color spaces, graph drawing, computational geometry, generative design, and visualization of data and algorithms. 
 - Consider issues of algorithmic efficiency in performing computationally intensive tasks. 
 - Investigate topics from both theoretical and applied perspectives.
