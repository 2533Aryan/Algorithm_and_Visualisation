      <h1>Cellular Automata Activity</h1>
      
      <p>For this exercise, you will simulate the cellular automata, Rule 90, by hand. To start, how do you express the number 90 in binary?</p>
      
      <p>Once you've expressed 90 in binary, use this representation to depict Rule 90 below. Note that you can change the colors of the lower tiles by clicking on them.</p>
      
      <div id="rules" class="container"></div>

      <p>In the space below, draw the space-time diagram of Rule 90 starting from the given initial condition. Note that the tiles in the first row (initial configuration) are fixed, while you can change the colors of the tiles </p>
