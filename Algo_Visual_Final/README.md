# Project 1: Machine Learning with Interactive Visualizations

- This project involves generating a dataset and visualizing it using the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. 
- The resulting visualization shows the data points as circles on a black background, with different fill colors representing each type. 
- The KNN algorithm determines the classification of each data point based on its nearest neighbors.

# Project 2: ProfMatch

- ProfMatch is a web application designed to match students with professors based on their areas of study. 
- The application allows students to enter their areas of interest, retrieves a list of professors from a JSON file, and then calculates a matching score for each professor based on their areas of study. 
- The top three matching professors are displayed to the user.
